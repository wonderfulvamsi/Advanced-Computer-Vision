# Next-Gen-Cameras..
I have designed an innovative method 2 capture images/videos @ all angles, not just 1...!!
Usually, our traditional cameras are capable of capturing the videos/images in the Front view only.

But in case of training a Deep Neural Network, we often required lots of Data especially for complex tasks like  Face Recognition images captured at multiple angles can be beneficial & can lead to a drastic increment of the ML model accuracy..!!

Proper implementation of my techniques can save Electricity, Data Space and the cost involved buying & maintaining more cameras.

Sorry for the typos.ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ

prerequisites->Basic knowledge about mirrors & lenses..

2 know more about 'me pls read the ppt..i hope u enjoy..

:)
